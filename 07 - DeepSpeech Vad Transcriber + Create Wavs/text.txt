Your living-room is very beautiful!

Two sugars, no milk, please.
Help yourself to the cookies.

Come back again. It was good to see you.
What are you up to today?
Nothing really. Why?
Would you like to go to the cinema tonight?
Yeah, what’s on?
I was thinking. Do you want to meet up for a drink some time?
Sounds good!
What about tomorrow evening?
I am busy this week maybe next week some time?
I was wondering if you would have dinner with me?
Dinner? Why not? When?
How about tonight?
Sorry, I can’t make it tonight.
Can you make it tomorrow then?
Yes, tomorrow is fine.
Would you like to go out some time?
That’s nice of you, but I’m already seeing someone.
What are you doing this weekend?
I am going to my parent’s place. Why?
I just thought we could grab a coffee sometime.
No, sorry. You're a nice guy, but I'm just not into you in that way.
I’ve just moved here. Are there any good coffees in the area?
There’s a good Chinese place near here.
Would you like to join me for dinner there sometime?
I’m not sure. I don’t even know you.
Right, but you seem like a really nice person, and I want to get to know you better.
I just saw you, and I think you look really nice.
Thank you.
What are you doing right now?
Just taking a walk.
Then why don’t we have a coffee over here.
I want to tell you that you look very pretty, and I want to get to know you.
Thank you.
Can you give me your number, so I can call you sometime?
Okay.
I enjoyed talking to you and would like to get to know you better.  If you feel the same, here's my number.
I’ll call you.
Nice day, isn’t it.
Yeah, it’s lovely outside.
It looks like it’s going to snow.
I hear they are calling for snow all weekend.
I can’t believe how quiet this place is today.
Strange, isn’t it? It’s usually packed on Fridays.
Can you believe all this rain we’ve been having?
Yes, we sure have!
I love your outfit! May I ask where you got it?
Thank you. I got it at Zara.
Getting excited about your trip?
Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it.
How much do you earn?
I’d rather not say.
I’ve heard you’ve split up with Christy.
If it’s okay with you, I’m not really up to talking about it.
Can we meet on the sixteenth of July?
Yes, it’s fine with me.
Can you make it on Friday morning?
Yes, it suits me perfectly.
Are you available on Thursday evening?
I’m afraid I can’t make it on Thursday evening. What about a bit earlier on Thursday? Say, three pm?
What about Saturday?
I’m afraid I can’t on Saturday. Can we meet on Sunday instead?
We were going to meet on Friday but something has come up. Can we fix another time?
Sure. Would Monday be ok?
I’m afraid, I won’t be able to meet you after all. Can we make another time later in the week?
What time is best for you?
