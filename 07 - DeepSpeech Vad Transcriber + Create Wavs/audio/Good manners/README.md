Good morning! How are you?
I’m fine, thanks. How are you?
Hello! How are you doing?
Fine, just fine. How are you?
Hi, how is it going?
Pretty good. How about you?
Hi, what’s up?
Not much. What about you?
What have you been up to?
The same as usual.
How to thank people?
Thank you for looking after my son.
You’re very welcome.
Thanks for your help.
No problem.
Thank you for carrying my bag.
Don’t mention it.
That’s very kind of you, but you really shouldn’t have gone to all this trouble.
I was happy to help.
